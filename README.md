# Diabetes-Data-Analysis
Healthcare data analysis SQL project on diabetes.


## Introduction  
Diabetes affects millions globally, leading to serious complications. Our goal is to design a structured, normalized database that integrates lifestyle, genetic, and medical data for better analysis of diabetes risks and progression.

## Database Description  
We built a normalized relational schema centered around a `Patients` table linked to six other tables covering lab results, medical history, lifestyle factors, and more.

## Key Features  
- Normalized design for efficient querying  
- Sample dataset of 15 filtered patients  
- Complex views joining multiple tables for analysis  

## Ethical Considerations  
We address representation, privacy, and genetic/environmental bias concerns in our data and analysis.

## How to Use  
- Run SQL scripts in the `SQL` folder to create tables and insert sample data  
- Use provided views and queries to explore diabetes risk factors

## Future Work  
- Scale dataset to 1000+ patients  
- Add more detailed health metrics and symptoms  
- Improve normalization and advanced queries
